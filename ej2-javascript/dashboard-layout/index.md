The **DashboardLayout** is a grid structured layout component that helps to create a static and dynamic dashboard layouts with panels. Dashboard panels are the basic building blocks of the dashboard and can be added programmatically or dynamically at runtime. The panels hold the UI components and allow resize, reorder, drag-n-drop, remove and add options. This allows users to easily place the components at the desired position within the grid layout.

## Key features

1. **Drag and Drop**: Allows drag and drop of panels at the desired location within the dashboard layout.

2. **Resizing**: Support to resize the panels in any direction as per the requirement.

3. **Floating**: Floats the panels upward when the dragging option is enabled.

4. **Media Query**: Allows the panels to be stacked when the specified resolution is met.
